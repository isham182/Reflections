Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. You would want to use a remote depository when you are working from a different computer, or someone else is also making changes

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. If Git always automatically updated everytime someone made a repository you might end up with a version on your computer you dont want.
   So being able to manually pull allows you to do so only when you know its safe to do so.
